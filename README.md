<p>We are pleased to announce a new feature to the audience building area of the Profiles tool- ‘Complete Cases’. </p>

<ul>
<p>This is a check box that will be automatically selected to specify that your audience should be made up of respondents who have answered every single component of your definition. This would not make a difference for any audiences where you are linking variables with ‘AND’, but it would have an impact for where you are linking variables with ‘OR’.</p>

<p>Editors can grant access to different folders to different sets of users. Multiple clients, or multiple groups or teams within a client, can be granted access to just the data you want to show them. Furthermore, you can move a dataset into a folder to instantly make it available to all users who have access to that folder.</p>
</ul>

<p>These new features in turn bring some changes to our web application. Here are some key differences from the old interface.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>The benefit of this change will be particularly focused on when you want to create a new custom variable with your audience that you plan to incorporate as a row in your tables, e.g. what % of your target group meet the definition of this new custom variable. This ‘Complete Cases’ approach will ensure that we are certain your respondents had the chance to answer every one of the components of your new variable. 
When using a custom variable that you created with ‘Complete Cases’, the % and associated market size should avoid the potential for extreme numbers. In the past, you may have found very high or low market sizes that were influenced by the base size used without ‘complete cases’ specified. 
</p>


<h2 id="when">When should I un-select this check box?</h2>

<p>If your audience is only going to be used as a filter or column in a table, you may not mind if the respondents have answered every single part of the definition. In these scenarios you may only need the respondent to have met one of your criterion to be included and so it doesn’t matter if they didn’t answer all of them. For these instances, you could de-select the ‘Complete Cases’ check box and maximize sample size for your audience or filter.</p>

<h2 id="what">What will I notice as different?</h2>

<p>With the ‘Complete Cases’ check box ticked on, as you create custom audiences and add more variables into your definition via ‘OR’ linkages, you may see your base size decline. This is because the tool is limiting your base to people who have answered all of the variables you’re including, that may have varying degrees of overlap. As mentioned above, if you are only focused on creating an audience with the largest base size possible, you should de-select ‘Complete Cases’.</p>

<ul><p> If you have any questions, please consult your client service representative. </ul></p>

<ul><p> Thank you</ul></p>
